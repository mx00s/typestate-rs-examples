// NB: `#[typestate]` injects a diagram of the state machine in the docs here.

/// Simple state machine with two states and one self-transition, as rendered
/// above.
///
/// `typestate` requires an initial state and a final state. Here we arbtirarily
/// selected `Opened` for both.
///
/// # Example
///
/// Let's create an [`Opened`] door, close it, ring the door bell 3 times, open
/// it again, and finally stop the state machine.
///
/// ```rust
/// let door = Door::<Opened>::initial();
/// let door = door.close();
/// for _ in 0..=2 {
///     door.ring_bell();
/// }
/// let door = door.open();
/// door.r#final();
/// ```
///
/// The execution of the example is reflected in this [`mod@tracing`] output:
///
/// ```
/// DEBUG initial: door: created automaton output=Door { state: Opened }
/// DEBUG close: door: closing self=Door { state: Opened }
/// TRACE door: dropping
/// DEBUG ring_bell: door: ðŸ”” self=Door { state: Closed }
/// DEBUG ring_bell: door: ðŸ”” self=Door { state: Closed }
/// DEBUG ring_bell: door: ðŸ”” self=Door { state: Closed }
/// DEBUG open: door: opening self=Door { state: Closed }
/// TRACE door: dropping
/// DEBUG r#final: door: automaton self-destructing in 3, 2, ... ðŸ’¥ self=Door { state: Opened }
/// TRACE door: dropping
/// ```
